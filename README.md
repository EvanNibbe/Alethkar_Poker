# Alethkar_Poker
This is a card game derived from the game explained in the Brandon Sanderson book, "The Way of Kings." <br>
The basis for the rules is to create an incentive system such that someone who consistently gets high cards will not lose very many chips, given the proportional allocation structure. Furthermore, if a player thinks they have winning cards that round (because the maximum value of chips that any player can lose in a round is set by the amount of chips in the winning player's black bag (you could probably call this a "betting bag"), every player who thinks they can win that round will put many chips into their bag; this lack of safety of the chips a person risks is further backed up (in a counter-intuitive way) by the distribution policy of (1) the winning player that round gets to keep all the chips in the winning player's bag, and (2) all other chips in other black bags are pooled at the table and divided back to players on the basis of what fraction of the total value of all hands was that particular player's hand (thus meaning that you will get back a large fraction of your winnings when you have a high-value hand, even if you don't actually win that round)) the player will put many chips into their black bag. <br>
The proportional distribution policy was play-tested, and during the play-test, the players found counting up the value of the cards and chips far too cumbersome for their liking, and, since it was a recreational game, they immediately elected to just have the winner take all the chips. However, in the historical context of the Alethkar kingdom on the continent Roshar in the Brandon Sanderson book "The Way of Kings", the whole point of the rules system is to allow players to make money while betting their estimated value of the cards currently in their own hand, and, in order to avoid getting hit with the massive social taboo of being called out for trying to predict the future, they must have a winning strategy they can describe without assuming to predict what the other cards will be. <br>
Therefore, since such a winning strategy must necessarily rely on figuring out the values of people's hands as a way to divide up the betting pot, the rule which seems cumbersome is absolutely necessary in order for the game to work whatsoever. <br>
There is a good case to be made that this game would work better if it were computerized, rather than involve physically writing values on paper.
